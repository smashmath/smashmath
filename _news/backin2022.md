yeah, i've been kinda busy with school and all. but i'm back with three new posts to blow your socks off or whatever.

1. [Series Solutions Done Quick](/math/seriessolutions){:target="_blank"} finally. i've been wanting to do this for months. series solutions kinda suck but this is a way that makes them pretty fast (or at least a lot faster than the normal method).
2. [Column and Row Perspective](/math/columnperspective){:target="_blank"}. when i tutor or help students with linear algebra (including students taking a second level advanced linear algebra course), i usually find they're a lot slower with matrix multiplication and finding null vectors than they could be. when i show them the "column perspective", they tell me it's a huge time saver. so i made a post to more easily share it. even if you are beyond an intro course, if you deal with matrices at all, this is useful.
3. [Bases for the fundamental spaces of a matrix](/math/rowcolspace){:target="_blank"}. this is a topic that a lot of students taking an intro to linear algebra tend to find confusing. so i made a post which is hopefully easy to understand. maybe it'll be useful for students beyond an intro class too.
