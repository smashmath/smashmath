[Matrix Exponential Formulas for 2x2 Matrices](/math/2x2ezmatrixexp){:target="_blank"} has been mostly rewritten.

i wrote it in may when i found a way to derive them using the laplace transform which i thought was really cool. and i still think it is, but its also a lot more difficult than it needs to be. i had forgotten that i used the laplace transform until i saw the post again today (updating it to the distill theme). on rereading it, i realized that itd be easier to use the [method utilizing normalized solutions](/math/matrixexpwde){:target="_blank"} i found in september.

although this method is easier and far more concise, the fact that the method is not immediately obvious might be less accessible. especially for students who *are* familiar with laplace transforms but not [normalized solutions](/math/normalized){:target="_blank"}. for that reason the [old post](/math/ezmatrixexp){:target="_blank"} is available in a new category, "archive".

so yeah. not to diss laplace transforms because they're super baller. but they are slightly less baller when it comes to matrix systems. 

thanks for reading i guess.
