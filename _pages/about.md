i like linear algebra, differential equations, and long walks on the beach. :sunglasses:

$$\exp(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}$$

[here are some math things ive done if you want to look at them i guess](./math)

personal favorites:

[The Alpha Method (Generalized Exponential Response Formula)](./alphamethod)

[Shortcuts for Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](./eigentricks)

[Solving Systems of First Order DE's like a boss](./firstordersystemsquick)

[Matrix Exponential Formulas for 2x2 Matrices](./ezmatrixexp)
