$$\exp(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}$$

local boy does math. "is okay at it" says friends and family.

[here are some math posts ive written if you want to look at them i guess](./math){:target="_blank"}

personal favorites:

- [The Alpha Method (Generalized Exponential Response Formula)](./math/alphamethod){:target="_blank"}
- [Shortcuts for Finding Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors](./math/eigentricks){:target="_blank"}
- [Solving systems of first-order ODEs like a boss](./math/firstordersystemsquick){:target="_blank"}

my research stuff:

things ive ~~discovered~~ independently derived. i think they're all cool, but only a few of them are actually useful, in my opinion.

- [Function Interpolation](./math/functioninterp){:target="_blank"}: a method to get a function (which is a linear combination of some given set of basis functions) that satisfies certain conditions using determinants, given that one exists and is unique. for example, a determinant which gives the unique lowest degree polynomial that passes through a certain set of points.

- [A formula for some particular solutions to certain ODEs](./math/exppolynonhomo){:target="_blank"}: a determinant formula which gives a particular solution to any linear constant-coefficient ordinary differential equation which has a forcing function of exponential nature (ex. $$g(t)=t^ne^{\alpha t}\cos(\beta t)$$). Uses results from [Function Interpolation](./math/functioninterp){:target="_blank"}.

- [Constructing integer systems of differential equations with integer solutions](./math/firstordersystems){:target="_blank"}: methods to construct nice systems with nice solutions. useful for professors/textbook authors to make good lecture examples or exam problems. somewhat of a work in progress. i also have a post for [second order systems](./math/secondordersystems){:target="_blank"}.

- matrix exponential stuff: i really love matrix exponentials.
1. [Matrix Exponential Formulas for 2x2 Matrices](./math/firstordersystems){:target="_blank"}
2. [Matrix Exponentials Using Differential Equations](./math/firstordersystems){:target="_blank"}
3. [Exponentials of Symmetric Matrices Using the Spectral Theorem](./math/firstordersystems){:target="_blank"}
4. [Matrix Exponential Formulas for 2x2 Matrices Using Laplace Transforms](./math/firstordersystems){:target="_blank"}
5. Another approach to matrix exponential formulas: coming soon...

- [New Ways to Calculate Normalized Solutions to Linear Constant-Coefficient Differential Equations](./math/newnormalized){:target="_blank"}: solve just *one* set of $$n$$ first-order initial value problems to get the $$n$$ normalized solutions to an $$n$$-th order differential equation. this should be the fastest way to find them using a computer. alternatively, find one normalized solution and get the others recursively.

the picture is not me. it is a stock photo that i bought and have the license to use.
